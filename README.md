# [Built With React Website](http://builtwithreact.io)

A list of user interfaces built with [react](http://facebook.github.io/react/).

This project was inspired by a [list](https://github.com/facebook/react/wiki/Sites-Using-React) of sites using react available on the [repository](https://github.com/facebook/react/). We thought that it might be a good idea to have a site listing all the cool projects built using react, so we made it.

### Submissions
We are trying to keep the site submission quality as high as possible. Please only submit real world applications running in production environments. Make sure that you can link to the application directly and no demos or proof-of-concepts. Only finished applications allowed.

### How to submit
To submit a site suggestions, [open an issue](https://github.com/GetBlimp/built-with-react/issues/new) or create a pull request. Pull requests will be given higher priority since they are easier to include.

Make sure the screenshot is **1000×800** for desktop apps/websites and **750×1330** for mobile apps/websites and please double check that everything looks good before submitting. It's also a good idea to run the screenshot through an image optimizer like [ImgSquash](https://imgsquash.com/) (built with React :smile:), [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/) or [ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com/) before including it. This will help keep the website fast and the repository small as possible.

### Running the site locally
```
$ gem install jekyll
$ git clone https://github.com/GetBlimp/built-with-react.git
$ cd built-with-react
$ jekyll serve --watch
```
